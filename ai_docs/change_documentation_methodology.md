## Best Practices

### 1. Write for Multiple Audiences
- **Technical team**: Implementation details
- **Product team**: Feature impact
- **Future developers**: Context and decisions
- **AI tools**: Clear, structured information

### 2. Be Specific
```markdown
# Good
Modified `UserAuthService.validateToken()` to check token expiration before signature validation, reducing unnecessary cryptographic operations by 40%.

# Avoid
Improved authentication performance.
```

### 3. Include Context
```markdown
# Good
Chose Redis for session storage due to need for 100k concurrent sessions and 50ms response time requirement. Considered PostgreSQL but ruled out due to connection pool limitations.

# Avoid
Using Redis for sessions.
```

### 4. Document Failures
```markdown
## Failed Approach
Attempted to use database triggers for audit logging but encountered:
- Performance degradation (200ms added latency)
- Maintenance complexity
- Limited flexibility for business logic

Switched to application-level audit logging with async processing.
```
