*Generated by AI Setup Deployment Script v2.36.0 on 2025-09-05 16:30:56 UTC*

This guide compiles best practices for using Claude Code effectively across projects, based on Anthropic's official documentation and community insights.

## Core Philosophy

Claude Code is intentionally low-level and unopinionated, providing close to raw model access without forcing specific workflows. This creates a flexible, customizable, scriptable, and safe power tool.

## Setup & Configuration

### 1. Create CLAUDE.md Files
- Add project-specific instructions about how Claude should act
- Include coding standards, testing approaches, and project conventions
- Place in repository root for global context
- Update as project evolves

### 2. Tool Management
- Curate allowed tools carefully for security
- Use `--tools` flag to limit available tools when needed
- Install GitHub CLI (`gh`) for enhanced repository interactions

### 3. Context Management
- Use `/clear` command frequently to reset context window
- Keep sessions focused on specific tasks
- Review and clean up conversation history regularly
- **Document important patterns** for team knowledge
- **Archive key decisions** for future reference

## Recommended Workflows

### Explore, Plan, Code, Commit
1. **Explore**: Read relevant files and understand existing code
2. **Plan**: Create detailed implementation plan
3. **Code**: Implement solution following the plan
4. **Commit**: Make atomic commits with clear messages

### Test-Driven Development
1. Write tests first based on requirements
2. Confirm tests fail initially
3. Implement code to make tests pass
4. Refactor and optimize
5. Commit incrementally

### Visual Iteration
1. Take screenshots of current state
2. Provide visual mocks or designs
3. Implement to match the design
4. Iterate with feedback until complete

## Testing with Claude Code

### Comprehensive Testing Strategy
AI-assisted development requires rigorous testing to ensure code quality and catch subtle bugs that AI might introduce. Claude Code excels at generating, executing, and maintaining comprehensive test suites.

### Core Testing Workflows

**AI-Generated Test Creation:**
```bash
# Generate comprehensive test suite
claude-code "Create unit tests for the UserService class covering all methods and edge cases"

# Generate integration tests
claude-code "Create integration tests for the payment processing workflow"

# Generate E2E test scenarios
claude-code "Create end-to-end tests for the user authentication flow"
```

**Test-Driven Development with AI:**
1. **Requirements to Tests**: `claude-code "Convert these requirements into comprehensive test cases"`
2. **Test Implementation**: `claude-code "Implement code to make these tests pass"`
3. **Test Validation**: `claude-code "Review test coverage and suggest additional test cases"`
4. **Test Optimization**: `claude-code "Optimize these slow tests while maintaining coverage"`

### AI-Specific Testing Patterns

**Testing AI-Generated Code:**
- **Double-check logic**: AI-generated algorithms need thorough validation
- **Edge case testing**: AI might miss uncommon scenarios
- **Security validation**: Test for injection vulnerabilities in AI-generated queries
- **Performance testing**: Validate AI-generated solutions meet performance requirements

**Testing AI Tools and Prompts:**
- **Prompt consistency**: Test that prompts produce reliable results
- **Model validation**: Verify AI responses meet quality standards
- **Integration testing**: Test AI agent interactions and handoffs
- **Regression testing**: Ensure AI improvements don't break existing functionality

### Testing Documentation

**Document Testing Patterns:**
- **Test strategy decisions**: Document why certain testing approaches were chosen
- **Coverage analysis**: Record areas requiring additional testing
- **Performance benchmarks**: Track testing performance over time
- **Failure patterns**: Document and learn from test failures

**Testing Knowledge Base:**
- Maintain testing patterns in `ai_docs/patterns/testing-strategies.md`
- Document successful test approaches
- Share testing insights with the team
- Update patterns based on new learnings

### Testing Commands and Automation

**Custom Testing Commands:**
```bash
# Add to .claude/commands/
/test-unit - Run unit test suite with coverage
/test-integration - Run integration tests
/test-e2e - Run end-to-end test suite
/test-ai - Run AI-specific validation tests
/test-security - Run security testing suite
```

**CI/CD Integration:**
- **Automated test generation**: Use headless mode to generate tests in CI
- **Test quality validation**: Validate that AI-generated tests meet standards
- **Performance regression testing**: Monitor AI-generated code performance
- **Security scanning**: Automated security testing of AI-generated code

## Advanced Techniques

### Thinking Modes
Use progressive thinking levels for complex problems:
- `think` - Basic additional computation (4,000 tokens)
- `think hard` - Enhanced analysis (10,000 tokens) 
- `think harder` - Deep analysis
- `ultrathink` - Maximum computation (31,999 tokens)

### Multi-Claude Workflows
- Use multiple Claude instances for different aspects
- Assign specific roles (reviewer, implementer, tester)
- Coordinate between instances for complex projects

### Git Integration
- Leverage git worktrees for parallel development
- Use Claude for code review and analysis
- Automate routine git operations

## Claude Code Hooks and Automation

### Unified Hooks Methodology (v2.5.0+)

Claude Code supports a unified configuration approach that consolidates permissions, hooks, and commands into a single `.claude/settings.json` file.

#### Configuration Structure
```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "allow": ["fs:read", "fs:write", "process:execute"],
    "deny": ["fs:write:/etc/*"]
  },
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [],
    "PostToolUse": [],
    "Stop": []
  },
  "commands": {}
}
```

#### Automatic Hooks vs Manual Commands

**Automatic Hooks** (`scripts/hooks/`):
- Triggered by tool usage automatically
- Should be fast and non-intrusive
- Use for development workflow automation
- Examples: git workflows, code formatting, validation
- Template examples provided for customization

**Manual Commands** (`scripts/deployment/`):
- User-triggered via `/command` syntax
- Can be long-running operations
- Use for project-specific tasks
- Examples: deployment, testing, environment setup

#### Error Handling Best Practices

Hooks should use warning-based error handling:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
set +e  # Allow script to continue on errors

# Log warnings without failing
log_warning() {
    echo "⚠️ Warning: $1" >&2
}

# Always exit successfully to avoid blocking tools
exit 0
```

#### Hook Examples

**Pre-Tool Validation Hook**:
```bash
# scripts/hooks/validation.sh
if ! command -v git &> /dev/null; then
    log_warning "Git not available"
fi
```

**Post-Tool Cleanup Hook**:
```bash
# scripts/hooks/cleanup.sh
if [ "$CLAUDE_SAVE_SESSION" = "true" ]; then
    ./scripts/git/git-author-human.sh 2>/dev/null || log_warning "Failed to restore human author"
fi
```

### Custom Commands

#### Slash Commands
Create project-specific shortcuts:
```json
{
  "commands": {
    "test": {
      "description": "Run the test suite",
      "script": "npm test"
    },
    "deploy-dev": {
      "description": "Deploy to development",
      "script": "scripts/deployment/deploy-dev.sh $1"
    }
  }
}
```

#### Command Best Practices
- Include parameter validation in scripts
- Provide clear error messages
- Use exit codes appropriately
- Document expected parameters
- Make scripts executable (`chmod +x`)

### Automation Scripts
- Use headless mode for CI/CD integration
- Create custom workflows for repetitive tasks
- Integrate with existing development tools
- Set up automated code reviews

## Common Patterns

### Error Handling
- Always implement proper error handling
- Use project-consistent error patterns
- Log appropriately for debugging
- Consider edge cases and failure modes

### Performance Optimization
- Profile before optimizing
- Focus on bottlenecks first
- Measure impact of changes  
- Consider scalability implications

### Code Organization
- Follow existing project structure
- Maintain consistent naming conventions
- Group related functionality together
- Keep functions focused and small

## Troubleshooting

### Context Window Issues
- Use `/clear` to reset when performance degrades
- Split large tasks into smaller chunks
- Remove irrelevant conversation history
- Focus on current task requirements

### Performance Problems
- Reduce context size for faster responses
- Use specific rather than broad requests
- Avoid unnecessary file reads
- Clear unused conversation threads

### Tool Limitations
- Understand each tool's capabilities
- Work within security constraints
- Use appropriate alternatives when blocked
- Escalate to manual intervention when needed

## Integration Examples

### CI/CD Pipeline
```bash
# Example automated code review
claude-code --headless "Review this PR for security issues and code quality"
```

### Development Workflow
```bash
# Example feature development
claude-code "Implement user authentication with tests and documentation"
```

### Code Maintenance
```bash
# Example refactoring task
claude-code "Refactor payment processing module for better error handling"
```
