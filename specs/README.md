# Specifications Directory

*Generated by AI Setup Deployment Script v2.36.0 on 2025-09-05 16:30:56 UTC*

Store your project specifications, feature documentation, and technical designs here. This simplified structure focuses on active development specs with special handling for screenshots and archived content.

## Directory Structure

```
specs/
├── README.md                  # This file
├── screenshots/              # Visual documentation and UI mockups
│   └── README.md
├── archive/                  # Completed/outdated specifications
│   └── README.md
├── change_template.md        # Template for documenting changes
├── example_change_doc.md     # Example of change documentation
└── [your-spec].md           # Active specification documents
```

## Usage Guidelines

### Active Specifications
Place all active specification documents directly in the `/specs` root directory:
- Feature specifications
- Technical design documents
- API specifications
- Requirements documents
- Architecture decisions
- Change documentation

### Screenshots Directory
Use `/specs/screenshots/` for:
- UI mockups and wireframes
- Visual flow diagrams
- Screen captures for reference
- Design system examples
- Before/after comparisons

### Archive Directory
Move completed or outdated specs to `/specs/archive/`:
- Implemented features
- Deprecated designs
- Historical decisions
- Old requirements
- Previous iterations

## Change Documentation

For complex implementations, use the change documentation template:

1. Copy `change_template.md` to a new file (e.g., `feature_xyz_changes.md`)
2. Fill in all sections completely
3. Reference in pull requests and commits
4. Move to archive when implementation is complete

See `example_change_doc.md` for a complete example.

## Best Practices

1. **Keep specs current** - Update or archive as needed
2. **Use clear naming** - `feature_name_spec.md` or `YYYY-MM-DD_decision.md`
3. **Link liberally** - Reference related specs, code, and issues
4. **Version control** - Let git track changes, don't version in filenames
5. **Stay organized** - Archive completed work promptly

## Templates

- **Change Documentation**: Use `change_template.md` for complex implementations
- **Custom Templates**: Add your own templates as needed in the root directory

## Integration with AI Tools

This structure is optimized for AI-assisted development:
- Simple, flat structure for easy navigation
- Clear separation of active vs archived content
- Screenshot support for visual context
- Change documentation for handoffs and reviews
